\usage{
RVI_func(ID, DXcontrol, covariates, resp.range, EP, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{ID}{a column name of subject IDs in data.}

\item{DXcontrol}{an character string specifying control subset(i.e. DXcontrol='DX==0'). Mean and standard deviation for
z-normalization should be calculated in healthy controls.}

\item{covariates}{an optional character vector specifying column names of covariates (i.e. Age, Sex). If covariates=NULL,
residuals will not be adjusted for covariates.
If covariates are specified(i.e. covariates=c('Age','Sex')), residuals will be adjusted for covariates.}

\item{resp.range}{a numeric vector specifying column range of responses}

\item{EP}{a numeric vector specifying an expected pattern of measurements.}

\item{data}{a data frame contains a column of subject IDs, a column of controls, columns of covariates, columns of responses.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\item{i.norm.resid}{inverse-normal transformed(INT) residuals}
\item{z.norm.resid}{z-normalized INT residuals}
\item{RVI}{pearson correlation coefficient between the z-normalized INT residuals of subjects and their expected pattern}
}
\description{
The Regional Vulnerability Index (RVI), a statistical measure of brain structural abnormality, quantifies an individualâ€™s
similarity to the expected pattern of deficits seen in schizophrenia derived from large-scale meta-analyses by the ENIGMA
consortium. This package outputs the inverse-normal transformed residuals, z-normalized INT residuals, and the final RVI
coefficients.
}
\details{
The RVI is developed as a simple measure of agreement between an individual's pattern of regional neuroimaging traits and the expected
pattern of schizophrenia. First, residuals are extracted from simple linear regression by regressing out effects of optional covariates
(age, sex) and intracranial brain volume using the full sample (patients and controls). The residuals are inverse-normal transformed (INT)
based on residuals' ranks, and then the transformed residuals are z-normalized using mean and standard deviation calculated in healthy
controls. The RVI is then calculated as a Pearson correlation coefficient between z-normalized values of subjects and their expected
pattern. These expected patterns include cortical, subcortical, and white matter intracranial brain volumes for Schizophrenia Spectrum
Disorders (SSD).
