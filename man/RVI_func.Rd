\usage{
RVI_func(ID, DXcontrol, covariates = NULL, resp.range, EP, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{ID}{a column name of subject IDs in data.}

\item{DXcontrol}{a character string specifying control subset(i.e. DXcontrol='DX==0'or DXcontrol='DX=="CN"'). Mean and standard deviation for
z-normalization should be calculated in healthy controls.}

\item{covariates}{an optional character vector specifying column names of covariates (i.e. Age, Sex). If covariates=NULL (the default),
residuals will not be adjusted for any covariate. If covariates are specified (i.e. covariates=c('Age','Sex')), residuals will be adjusted for covariates.}

\item{resp.range}{a numeric vector specifying column range of regional neuroimaging traits.}

\item{EP}{a numeric vector specifying an expected pattern of measurements. Expected patterns(EP.WM, EP.GM and EP.Subcortical) for
WM, GM and Subcortical are included in the package(Note: If you use an expected pattern, you need to make sure the order of regional neuroimaging
traits in your data match up the corresponding order of the expected pattern). The patterns can be extract in the package (i.e. RVIpkg::EP.WM$SSD,
RVIpkg::EP.WM$MDD, RVIpkg::EP.WM$AD, RVIpkg::EP.WM$BD ,RVIpkg::EP.WM$PD .etc.). They were developed using neuroimaging data of UK Biobank (UKBB).}

\item{data}{a data frame contains a column of subject IDs, a column of controls, columns of covariates, columns of responses.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\item{i.norm.resid}{inverse-normal transformed(INT) residuals}
\item{z.norm.resid}{z-normalized INT residuals}
\item{RVI}{RVI:pearson correlation coefficient between the z.norm.resid of subjects and corresponding expected pattern. EDP: ENIGMA dot product.}
}
\description{
The Regional Vulnerability Index (RVI), a statistical measure of brain structural abnormality, quantifies an individualâ€™s
similarity to the expected pattern (effect size) of deficits seen in schizophrenia derived from large-scale meta-analyses by the ENIGMA
consortium. This package outputs the inverse-normal transformed residuals, z-normalized INT residuals, and the final RVI coefficients.
}
\details{
The RVI is developed as a simple measure of agreement between an individual's pattern of regional neuroimaging traits and the expected
pattern of schizophrenia. First, all observations of each regional neuroimaging trait are regressed out optional covariates using linear regression,
and then residuals are extracted from the model after removing effects of the optional covariates. The optional covariates could be age, sex,
intracranial brain volume and/or .etc in the data. After that the residuals are inverse-normal transformed (INT) based on residuals' ranks, and the transformed
residuals are z-normalized using mean and standard deviation calculated in healthy controls. For each subject, the RVI is then calculated as a Pearson correlation
coefficient between z-normalized values of all traits from the subject and expected pattern of the traits. These expected patterns include cortical thickness,
subcortical volume, and white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) for mental illnesses and metabolic diseases.
